### High Priority ###
Add user friendly login. ALlow for me to login and add items to the data structure through inputs rather than modifying the source code and uploading to heroku.

Move the 2d array into a postgres database. Data structure shoudln't be too complicated, and should reflect on the current 2d one in place currently

*** only do the first one when the second one is completed. 

### Low Priority ###
Get rid of the cheese I used for mobile friendliness.
	-> use a bunch of media queries
	-> make elements display: none;
